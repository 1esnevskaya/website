[Nint Digital Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (Nint)](https://www.nint.com) is a digital retail technology company with the mission of "Data makes the world free." The company focuses on providing decision support services to enterprises through big data analysis. Nint has established a broad service network in China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, with clients covering 80% of the global top 500 consumer goods companies, as well as thousands of brands and e-commerce stores.

In the wave of digital transformation, Nint has been exploring how to use technology to improve management efficiency and business decision-making. At the beginning of the digital transformation journey, Nint firmly chose to develop its own systems. **The reason was simple: there were too many customization needs, and the available products in the market at the time couldn't support them.**

## **Identifying Bottlenecks in In-House Digital Management Systems**

As Nint continues to expand, its in-house digital management system is facing several key challenges:

1. **Agility in Iteration**
   With rapid changes in business innovation and management demands, the need for faster iterations of the internal system has grown significantly, adding pressure on the digital development team.
2. **Cross-Department Collaboration**
   As business volume increases and operations expand, seamless collaboration across departments—including procurement, inventory, production, sales, HR, finance, assets, and marketing—has become crucial. Establishing a unified digital platform to integrate workflows, streamline processes, and provide clear operational pathways is now a pressing priority.
3. **Architectural Scalability**
   As enterprise management processes evolve, the existing system architecture struggles to keep up with dynamic business changes, hindering further improvements in operational efficiency.

Recognizing these challenges, Nint acknowledges that an in-house development model alone is no longer sufficient to support rapid business growth. To address these issues, the company is actively exploring more flexible and efficient solutions to enhance operational agility and scalability.

## **Breaking the Deadlock – Introducing No-Code Development Tools**

Nint’s digital transformation needs were clear:

1. Efficient management of people, finance, and tasks.
2. Comprehensive integration of multiple systems and data sharing.
3. Ensuring the security and autonomy of code and data.
4. Keeping construction and maintenance costs low.

After researching various digital tools on the market, Nint began to focus on the potential of open-source low-code/no-code platforms. The flexibility and ease of use of these tools could quickly meet the company's customization needs while significantly reducing development and maintenance costs. **After evaluating over 50 systems, Nint ultimately chose NocoBase as a key tool for their digital transformation.**

> We searched GitHub for low-code/no-code systems, and there were many systems available, offering a wide variety of features.
>
> Popular tools such as Storybook, Supabase, NocoDB, n8n, Directus, Appsmith, ToolJet, Budibase, Node-RED, ERPNext, and Odoo are all excellent tools with high ratings.
>
> During our selection process, we noted that many systems were either cloud services or had excessively high costs for local deployment, which limited their flexibility and cost-effectiveness.
>
> **Then we discovered NocoBase: open-source, drag-and-drop design, complete workflows, plugin system, simple technical architecture, and affordable commercial plugins. After researching over 50 systems, we decided to choose NocoBase.**

## Introduction

In Suzhou China, a team is quietly reinventing the world of personalized production. They don‚Äôt make fast-fashion goods or chase mass production, but they've built a loyal global following among cosplay fans.

Meet [KIGLAND](https://www.kigland.cn/) ‚Äî a studio that crafts 2D-style character head masks, known as KIGURUMI. These masks are highly personalized, tricky to customize, and require precise handiwork ‚Äî the perfect example of low-volume, high-variety manufacturing.

At first glance, they might seem like a niche artisan team.

But in reality, they‚Äôre more like a flexible manufacturing lab for entertainment products. By combining digital production, standardized workflows, and AI-driven supply chain innovation, **they‚Äôre transforming handcrafted creations into near-industrial products.**

## From GitHub Issues to Lark's Base

In its early days, KIGLAND ran things like a true hacker-style startup:

* Customer orders were tracked in GitHub Issues
* Production progress was updated in Lark's Base
* Feedback and communication were scattered across comments, screenshots, and chat threads

**Early use of GitHub Issues to manage orders:**

**Manage orders through Lark's Base:**

> ‚ÄúIt was manageable when we were small‚Äîbut as soon as the volume picked up, the whole system started to break down.‚Äù

The problems will sound familiar to anyone who‚Äôs scaled from side project to real operation:

* **Limited structure** ‚Äì Traditional Issue lists couldn‚Äôt handle the growing number of custom fields or stage-specific data needs across departments.
* **Workflow blind spots** ‚Äì Comments and discussions weren‚Äôt easily searchable or structured, making it hard to track progress.
* **Collaboration breakdown** ‚Äì Non-technical team members struggled with GitHub‚Äôs developer-oriented tools, and the spreadsheet setup required increasingly complex permission management.

As the communication overhead grew exponentially, KIGLAND knew it was time to stop patching things together‚Äîand start looking for a real system built for their unique needs.

## Looking for a System They Could Truly Own

As open-source veterans with strong technical backgrounds, KIGLAND‚Äôs founding team wasn‚Äôt looking for yet another bloated SaaS platform. They needed something different‚Äîsomething they could shape around their business, not the other way around.

> ‚ÄúWe wanted a tool that could grow with us‚Äînot a rigid platform we had to constantly work around.‚Äù

So they started exploring alternatives to traditional tools like Airtable. After testing several options, they landed on **NocoBase**.

The reasons were clear:

* **Flexible data modeling** to handle the complexity of custom orders
* **Plugin-based architecture with open APIs**, giving their team the freedom to extend functionality
* **User-friendly interface** with a shallow learning curve, even for non-developers
* **A fast-moving, active open-source community**
* And above all: **self-hostable and fully open**, giving them complete control over their system

## A Custom Management System‚ÄîBuilt in Just Three Weeks

In less than three weeks, KIGLAND had a fully functional internal management system built entirely on NocoBase. It was designed to match their workflows exactly, without compromise.

Their setup included:

* **End-to-end order lifecycle management** ‚Äì covering every step from order intake, design, and production, to quality control and shipping
* **Multi-role collaboration** ‚Äì with clearly defined permissions for sales, design, and production teams, ensuring smooth handoffs and accountability
* **Log-driven responsibility tracking** ‚Äì enabling full traceability and faster issue resolution
* **Flexible materials and inventory tracking** ‚Äì with custom categories, linked records, and real-time visibility

**Activity logs and traceability:**

**Linking logs to specific orders:**

Once the core system was up and running, the team continued to evolve it alongside NocoBase‚Äôs regular updates‚Äîadapting new features as they came and contributing feedback to the community.

## Three Quarters In, the Results Spoke for Themselves

> ‚ÄúAfter adopting NocoBase, we went from a scrambling small studio to one of the top teams in our niche.‚Äù

And the numbers back it up:

* üì¶ **3√ó increase** in order processing capacity
* ‚ùå **80% drop** in collaboration-related errors
* üòä **Significantly higher customer satisfaction**
* üîß **Greater self-sufficiency** for the tech team, with ongoing in-house development and iteration

But the biggest win? The team finally stepped out of the day-to-day grind and began focusing on growing the business and improving user experience.

Here‚Äôs what their customers had to say:

## Scaling Beyond the System

With NocoBase as their foundation, KIGLAND continues to expand what their internal systems can do‚Äîone step closer to building a fully automated, fully customized production pipeline.

Their roadmap includes:

* **AI-powered production scheduling** using self-hosted LLMs and a modular control platform (MCP)
* **Predictive manufacturing models** based on historical order data, enabling real-time dispatch to suppliers
* **Client-side ordering integration** for a fully standardized, end-to-end custom workflow

For KIGLAND, this isn‚Äôt just about adopting better tools‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic shift in how they scale.

## Final Thoughts

KIGLAND‚Äôs journey is a reminder of a simple but powerful truth:

**The more complex and personalized your business becomes, the more structure you need underneath. And if you want to scale, you can‚Äôt rely on manual processes alone.**

Their transformation wasn‚Äôt powered by an out-of-the-box solution‚Äîit was made possible by a system they could shape, extend, and evolve alongside their business.

For teams navigating digital transformation, the real breakthrough might not come from finding a perfect all-in-one platform‚Äîbut from building on something like **NocoBase**: a flexible, open foundation that grows with you.

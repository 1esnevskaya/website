## **Challenges Emerge with Opportunities**

As competition in the cross-border industry grows, GemelSoft focuses on artificial intelligence for new growth opportunities. This shift has expanded its customer base, increased business volume, and unlocked vast market potential.

With the rapid expansion of GemelSoft's business, many problems began to emerge in the internal system:

1. **Outdated system**: The previous system was slow, with data query results taking minutes to return, hindering productivity.
2. **Lack of flexibility**: Making simple modifications and additions to fields was often cumbersome and typically required developer intervention, leading to slow response times.
3. **Low level of digitalization**: The internal HR system was not fully implemented, affecting the overall workflow.
4. **Uneven distribution of resources**: Development resources focused mainly on external business, leaving internal system maintenance underemphasized and issues challenging to resolve promptly.

## Together with NocoBase: Upgrading the Internal Systems

GemelSoft's technical team explored various low-code and no-code platforms but found none that met their needs. Upon discovering NocoBase, the team appreciated its flexibility and scalability. After its successful deployment, GemelSoft effectively resolved several legacy issues:

1. **Enhanced System Agility and Efficiency**: The system's efficiency has improved significantly. Adding fields takes just five seconds, and modifying forms can be done in under ten minutes, enhancing flexibility and speeding up business processes.

## **Integrating the Enterprise Brain with NocoBase**

NocoBase has played a significant role in optimizing GemelSoft's internal system and has also enhanced the product technology architecture. As GemelSoft Software's flagship product in the wave of artificial intelligence, "Enterprise Brain" has been successfully implemented in various customer scenarios. NocoBase serves as a crucial link between the "Enterprise Brain" and the instant messaging (IM) platform, facilitating efficient data and information exchange and improving the product's overall capabilities.

In this model, the "Enterprise Brain" focuses on data analysis, while NocoBase manages data collection and distribution and executes complex business logic. This division allows the "Enterprise Brain" to concentrate on AI capabilities without complicating the system with specific customer needs.

For example, in the offline experience store project, NocoBase maintains the store manager profile and geolocation information. It also handles the location data customers share through WeChat and quickly matches the nearest experience stores. In the meantime, NocoBase integrates with the "Enterprise Brain" to execute API calls, manage data acquisition, and push customer information and recommendations through workflows, allowing the "Enterprise Brain" to finalize customer interactions.

Moreover, NocoBase effectively addresses the limitations of the "Enterprise Brain" in managing customer data and maintaining customer contact. Its flexible and automated features enhance the efficiency and intelligence of customer service, ultimately driving better outcomes.

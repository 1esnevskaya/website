## **Introduction: The Promise of Low-Code vs. the Reality of "Pitfalls"**

Low-code platforms promise to enable enterprises to build applications faster, reduce development costs, and decrease reliance on professional developers. However, many enterprises gradually discover hidden traps and hidden costs when they actually use low-code platforms.

Some users have shared their personal experiences in discussions, finding that while low-code platforms perform well in simple business scenarios, they often encounter a series of problems such as **poor scalability, vendor lock-in, cost surges, and performance bottlenecks in complex business scenarios**.

Experienced developers have even given explicit advice:

* "Strongly do not recommend IT teams to use low-code or no-code platforms"
* "Low-code platforms can easily make enterprises dependent on suppliers, and the cost of customization in the later stage is extremely high"
* "Functions that could be developed in 3 days take 10 or 20 days with low-code"
* "Low-code has poor scalability, developers have difficulty debugging, and there are too many black-box operations"

So, what are the hidden costs of low-code platforms? How to identify potential traps? And what strategies can be used to avoid falling into these traps? It is hoped that this article can provide you with some solutions.

## **Hidden Costs in Low-Code Platforms**

![Hidden Costs in Low-Code Platforms.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/8d8a279132cd77f4add8832628e1df61.png)

The hidden costs of low-code platforms are usually reflected in the following aspects:

### **Vendor Lock-In**

Vendor lock-in is one of the biggest risks that enterprises face when choosing low-code platforms. Many low-code platforms adopt **closed ecosystems and proprietary technologies**, making it difficult for enterprises to migrate to other platforms or manage data independently, and ultimately forcing them to continue using the platform even as costs rise.

**Typical problems:**

* **Difficult data migration**: Some low-code platforms do not support direct data export or the exported data format is incompatible with standard databases, increasing migration costs.
* **Limited system integration**: Some low-code platforms only allow integration with their own plugins and APIs, restricting the enterprise's ability to connect with third-party tools.
* **Risk of price increase**: Once an enterprise is deeply dependent on a certain platform, the platform can adjust subscription prices at any time, and the enterprise has little choice.

âœ… **How to identify vendor lock-in?**

* Does the platform support free data export and storage in standard formats?
* Does it provide standardized APIs that can be freely integrated with other systems?
* Does it explicitly promise not to restrict data migration?

ðŸ’¡ **Mitigation strategies:**

* Choose a platform that supports **open standards and self-deployment** to ensure long-term data control.

### **Subscription and Usage Costs**

Many low-code platforms charge based on factors such as the number of users, API call frequency, and storage space, leading to a significant increase in costs as the enterprise scales.

**Typical problems:**

* **User-based charging**: Many low-code platforms charge based on the number of users, and costs will multiply as the team expands.
* **Extra charges for advanced features**: Core features such as data analysis, automated processes, and advanced reporting often require additional purchases.
* **Cost surges after the trial period**: Some platforms offer free or low-cost plans with limited functionality, forcing enterprises to upgrade to expensive enterprise editions eventually.

âœ… **How to identify hidden subscription costs?**

* Does the platform have limits on the number of users or API calls?
* How will subscription prices change as the enterprise expands?
* Is there a model where "basic functions are free, and advanced functions are charged separately"?

ðŸ’¡ **Mitigation strategies:**

* Choose a platform with **transparent pricing and no hidden fees**, and evaluate the long-term costs.

### **Security and Compliance Risks**

Data security is one of the core issues for enterprises, but many low-code platforms have hidden risks in terms of security and compliance, which may lead to problems such as **data leakage and compliance risks**.

**Typical problems:**

* **Limited data storage**: Some low-code platforms are hosted on the supplier's server by default, and enterprises cannot manage the data themselves.
* **Non-compliance with industry standards**: Some low-code platforms have not passed compliance certifications such as GDPR and HIPAA, which may lead to data security risks.
* **Data leakage risks**: Some platforms have insufficient security measures and are easy targets for hackers.

âœ… **How to identify security risks?**

* Does the platform offer local deployment options?
* Does it comply with industry security standards (ISO 27001, SOC 2)?
* Does it support data encryption and access control?

ðŸ’¡ **Mitigation strategies:**

* Choose a platform that supports **private deployment** and ensures **compliance with industry standards and security certifications**.

### **Technical Limitations**

The original intention of low-code platforms is to make development simpler, but this also brings serious **technical bottlenecks**, especially when the business logic of an enterprise becomes complex, the limitations of low-code platforms will gradually emerge.

**Typical problems:**

* **Performance bottlenecks**: Many low-code platforms have restrictions on the number of concurrent users, data storage capacity, computing power, etc., which affect business expansion.
* **Limited customization capabilities**: When the business processes of an enterprise exceed the default functions of the low-code platform, it may be difficult to meet the needs through simple configuration.
* **Black box operation, difficult debugging**: Many low-code platforms do not allow developers to directly access the underlying code, making debugging and optimization extremely difficult.

âœ… **How to identify technical bottlenecks?**

* Are there any restrictions on the number of concurrent users or computing resources?
* Does it support a plugin architecture for flexible expansion?

ðŸ’¡ **Mitigation strategies:**

* Choose a platform that supports a **plugin architecture** and has strong **expansion capabilities **to ensure sustainable development in the future.

### **Training and Maintenance Costs**

Although low-code reduces the development threshold, enterprises still need to invest a lot of resources in training and maintenance.

**Typical problems:**

* **Learning costs**: If the platform is complex, employees still need to learn how to use it, which affects production efficiency.
* **Technical support costs**: Some low-code platforms only provide paid support, and additional fees are required for consultation when problems occur.
* **Insufficient community support**: If the documentation is incomplete or there is no active community, enterprises may have difficulty obtaining help.

âœ… **How to identify additional training and maintenance costs?**

* Does the platform provide complete free documentation and tutorials?
* Is there an active community support?
* Are there additional technical support costs?

ðŸ’¡ **Mitigation strategies:**

* Choose a platform with **complete documentation** and **an active community** to reduce maintenance costs.

## **Low-code platforms that break through hidden costs**

Although most low-code platforms have the above problems, there are also some open-source low-code platforms that are constantly optimizing and gradually breaking through these limitations.

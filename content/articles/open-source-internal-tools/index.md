Welcome back to our GitHub Star series!

In previous articles, we delved into GitHub's most popular open-source low-code projects, "[Top 15 Open-Source Low-Code Projects with the Most GitHub Stars](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/top-15-open-source-low-code-projects-with-the-most-github-Stars)," and open-source no-code tools, "[The Top 12 Open-Source No-Code Tools with the Most GitHub Stars](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/the-top-12-open-source-no-code-tools-with-the-most-github-stars)," receiving enthusiastic feedback. This week, we continue the GitHub Star series by focusing on internal tools that not only enhance work efficiency but also drive business process innovation.

It's worth noting that, in addition to Star counts, this article incorporates data on Forks, Issues, Pull Requests, and Contributors from GitHub. These dimensions provide developers with a more comprehensive perspective, revealing the actual usage, development activity, and community contributions of these tools, offering a holistic evaluation.

To present a more comprehensive view of the diversity and impact of these internal tools, we have divided the 11 tools into two groups:

**The first group**: Internal tools with **over 10k stars**, where we will detail each tool's highlights, including core features and use cases.

**The second group**: Internal tools with **fewer than 10k stars**, providing brief introductions to each tool.

## **First Group**: GitHub Star > 10k

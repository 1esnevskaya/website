In the era of information explosion, dull text no longer satisfies our needs for data presentation. The Markdown block provided by NocoBasenot only displays text and HTML but also renders intuitive and elegant charts using Mermaidâ€”bringing your data to life! Even more exciting, by combining Handlebars template variables, you can have the charts dynamically refresh based on real-time data, truly visualizing your business data.

## 1. Overview of NocoBase Markdown Blocks and Vditor Fields

NocoBase's Markdown block has long been regarded as one of the most commonly used and powerful blocks in the system. It can display simple text and HTML, as well as embed complex logic to support business processes and dynamic interactions. This allows you to enjoy multiple functionalities within a single block.

- **Page Markdown Block**:

  - Used on system pages, pop-ups, and forms to display notifications, guidance, and tips.
  - Lightweight and flexible, suitable for quick display and real-time updates.
  - Supports Handlebars template variables.
- **Markdown (Vditor) Field**:

  - Offers a more comprehensive feature set; in addition to supporting Markdown formatting, it can render mathematical formulas, charts, animations, and other interactive effects.
  - Ideal for scenarios that demand a higher quality of display, such as complex data reports or interactive documents.

No matter the scenario, Mermaid charts are a powerful tool for data visualization. Moreover, the flexibility of Handlebars template variables and data fields makes our blocks dynamic and intelligent.

## 2. Mermaid Charts: Bringing Your Data to Life

Mermaid is a text-based chart drawing tool that supports various types of charts. Below, we introduce several commonly used charts and demonstrate how to implement them in Markdown.

### 2.1 Flowchart

A flowchart uses simple syntax to describe a business process, illustrating the relationships between steps.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start Project] --> B[Plan Requirements]
    B --> C[Design Prototype]
    C --> D[Develop Implementation]
    D --> E[Test & Deploy]
```

**Application Scenario**: Used to illustrate project development, business processes, operational steps, and more.
**Extension**: By combining Handlebars template variables, node names can be set dynamically. For example:

Suppose we need an illustration for business opportunity conversion. We can use Handlebars template variables to dynamically set node names. Consider the following business data:
Here, "Zhang San" represents the lead data, "account" is the contact (many-to-one), and "opportunity" contains the business opportunity information (many-to-one).

```json
{
  "name": "Zhang San",
  "phone": "13800138000",
  "company": "Beijing Company",
  "industry": "IT",
  "account": {
    "name": "Li Si",
    "industry": "IT"
  },
  "opportunity": {
    "stage": "Nurturing",
    "status": "Transferred"
  }
}
```

In a popup or form, we use Handlebars template variables to dynamically set the node names.

```mermaid
graph LR
    U[Unqualified<br/>Name: {{$nRecord.name}}<br/>Phone: {{$nRecord.phone}}]
    N[New<br/>Company: {{$nRecord.company}}<br/>Industry: {{$nRecord.industry}}]
    W[Working<br/>Account Manager: {{$nRecord.account.name}}<br/>Industry: {{$nRecord.account.industry}}]
    T[Nurturing/Transferred<br/>Opportunity Stage: {{$nRecord.opportunity.stage}}<br/>Status: {{$nRecord.status}}]

    U --> N
    N --> W
    W --> T
```

> NOTE: For variables containing special characters (such as the @ symbol in emails, quotation marks, etc.), errors may occur. You can flexibly opt for an HTML solution based on the situation.

### 2.2 Sequence Diagram

This diagram displays the interaction process between multiple objects or roles, clearly showing the order of message passing.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Frontend as Frontend System
    participant Backend as Backend Service
    participant Database as Database

    User->>Frontend: Visit Page
    Frontend->>Backend: Request Data
    Backend->>Database: Query Data
    Database-->>Backend: Return Query Result
    Backend-->>Frontend: Return Data
    Frontend-->>User: Display Data
```

**Application Scenario**: Suitable for illustrating API calls, system interaction flows, business processing sequences, etc.

### 2.3 Gantt Diagram

Used for project schedule management, this diagram shows the timing and dependencies of various tasks.

```mermaid
gantt
    title Project Timeline
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Planning
    Requirements Analysis  :done, 2024-03-01, 2024-03-10
    Design  :active, 2024-03-11, 2024-03-20
    section Development
    Frontend Development  : 2024-03-21, 2024-04-10
    Backend Development  : 2024-03-25, 2024-04-15
    section Testing
    Unit Testing  : 2024-04-16, 2024-04-20
    Integration Testing  : 2024-04-21, 2024-04-30

    Production Deployment  : 2024-05-01, 2024-05-05
    Maintenance  : 2024-05-06, 2024-05-15
```

![20250321000352](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250321000352.png)

**Application Scenario**: Ideal for project management, production planning, event scheduling, and similar contexts.

### 2.4 Class Diagram

A class diagram is used to display the relationships and attributes among various objects in a system, making it ideal for describing object-oriented design structures.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal {
      +String name
      +int age
      +eat()
      +sleep()
    }
    class Dog {
      +bark()
    }
    Animal <|-- Dog
```

**Application Scenario**: Demonstrates system modules, object relationships, class structures, etc.

Based on the data above, we create a dynamic class diagram linking leads, contacts, and business opportunities:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Lead {
      +String name  [{{$nRecord.name}} ]
      +String phone  [{{$nRecord.phone}} ]
      +String company  [{{$nRecord.company}} ]
      +String industry  [{{$nRecord.industry}} ]
    }
    class Account {
      +String name  [{{$nRecord.account.name}} ]
      +String industry  [{{$nRecord.account.industry}} ]
    }
    class Opportunity {
      +String stage  [{{$nRecord.opportunity.stage}} ]
      +String status  [{{$nRecord.opportunity.status}} ]  
    }
    Lead <|-- Account
    Account <|-- Opportunity
```

  "tooltip": { "trigger": "axis" },
  "legend": { "data": ["Posts", "Users", "Replies"] },
  "xAxis": [{
    "type": "category",
    "data": ["Day 1", "Day 2", "Day 3", "Day 4", "Day 5"]
  }],
  "yAxis": [{
    "type": "value"
  }],
  "series": [
    {
      "name": "Posts",
      "type": "line",
      "data": [15, 20, 10, 25, 30]
    },
    {
      "name": "Users",
      "type": "line",
      "data": [50, 40, 60, 70, 80]
    },
    {
      "name": "Replies",
      "type": "line",
      "data": [5, 8, 6, 10, 12]
    }
  ]
}
```

```echarts
{
  "title": { "text": "Monthly Sales Data" },
  "tooltip": { "trigger": "axis" },
  "legend": { "data": ["Sales", "Target"] },
  "xAxis": [{
    "type": "category",
    "data": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June"]
  }],
  "yAxis": [{
    "type": "value"
  }],
  "series": [
    {
      "name": "Sales",
      "type": "bar",
      "data": [120, 200, 150, 80, 70, 110]
    },
    {
      "name": "Target",
      "type": "bar",
      "data": [100, 180, 130, 90, 60, 100]
    }
  ]

### 3.3 Mathematical Formulas

Vditor supports the rendering of both inline and block-level mathematical formulas using LaTeX syntax.

#### Block Formula

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

#### Inline Formula

The solution to a quadratic equation is given by \($x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$)

> Note: Troubleshooting formula rendering:
>
> * **Delimiter Usage:** Ensure that you are using the correct delimiters (block formulas with `$$` and inline formulas with `\(...\)` or `$...$`).
> * **Browser Compatibility:** Some browsers may require additional configuration or fonts to display mathematical formulas correctly.

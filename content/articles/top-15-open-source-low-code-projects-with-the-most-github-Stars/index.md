Last week, we published an article titled "[The Top 12 Open-Source No-Code Tools with the Most GitHub Stars](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/the-top-12-open-source-no-code-tools-with-the-most-github-stars)," which received much appreciation. Many friends commented asking why well-known products like n8n and Appsmith were not on the list. The reason is that we based this list on the "no-code" tag on GitHub, while these products were only tagged as "low-code."

In today's article, we will review low-code projects. It's important to note that there is some overlap between no-code and low-code products ([as these concepts do share similarities](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/what-is-no-code)). Building on our previous article, we will add three additional dimensions to comprehensively evaluate these projects:

1. Open Source License
2. Number of Active Contributors
3. Acceptance of External PRs

During our exploration of the most popular open-source low-code projects on GitHub, we discovered several compelling tools.

**[NocoBase](https://www.nocobase.com/en/plugins)**, with its highly scalable plugin architecture, enables businesses to quickly build and expand applications.

**[Supervision](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/how_to/detect_and_annotate/)** focuses on simplifying the training, deployment, and monitoring of computer vision models, providing efficient data annotation and model optimization tools.

**[Refine](https://refine.dev/)** offers complete control over React code, making it ideal for building and maintaining enterprise-level internal tools, with an emphasis on security and modularity.

**[n8n](https://n8n.io/)** is an open-source workflow automation tool that simplifies complex system integrations and data processing through visual programming.

These tools offer developers a variety of solutions, helping them quickly create powerful applications. Let's take a closer look at these low-code projects now!

**Firebase is great, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution.**

If you've ever built an app or website on your own, Firebase was probably your first thought for a backend. It bundles almost all common features: user authentication, real-time databases, file storage, push notifications, web hosting, and more. Plus, it's backed by Google and offers a generous free tier, making it seem like a developer's dream tool.

![Firebase](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/1-1m0vg7.PNG)

However, as your project grows, you might run into these issues:

* Your data is locked into Google's ecosystem, making migration expensive.
* Want to use a custom database structure or extend complex permissions?
* It's challenging to implement. Costs quickly escalate once you exceed the free tier.
* Lack of self-hosting options makes it difficult for teams with strict privacy and data compliance requirements to use.

If you've started to wonder, "Are there more flexible and controllable options out there?" Then this article is exactly what you need.

## How to Evaluate a Firebase Alternative?

When looking for a Firebase replacement, I set a few essential criteria. Not every open-source project is ready for production use‚Äîespecially if you want something that works seamlessly out of the box like Firebase. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs crucial to choose tools that offer complete functionality and a refined user experience.

![Firebase Alternative](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/2-h1kxqg.PNG)

Here are the key factors I believe matter most:

**1. Self-Hosting Support**

Can you deploy the entire system on your own server, private cloud, or local environment? This is critical for ensuring data privacy, meeting compliance requirements, and keeping long-term costs in check.

**2. Comprehensive Features**

Firebase includes modules for authentication, databases, file storage, hosting, and more. A strong alternative should provide a similarly complete suite of core features‚Äînot just a piece of the puzzle.

**3. Database Flexibility and Modeling**

Does it let you choose and configure databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite? Does it support data modeling, complex queries, and many-to-many relationships? These are key to flexibility and scalability.

**4. Permissions and Security**

Does it allow user grouping, role-based access control, and field-level permissions? These features are essential when building robust, real-world business systems.

**5. Documentation and Community Support**

Even the best tools fall short without solid documentation and an active community. Look for projects that are well-maintained, have clear guides, and show strong activity on platforms like GitHub.

**6. Frontend Integration Options**

Are there REST or GraphQL APIs available? Are there mature SDKs for JavaScript, Flutter, or iOS? Smooth integration is often a deciding factor for frontend developers.

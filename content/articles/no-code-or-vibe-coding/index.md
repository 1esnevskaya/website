## **Introduction**

In early 2025, it felt like every day on Reddit I came across the same question: *“Will Vibe Coding replace no-code?”*

The buzz was everywhere—people were excitedly sharing experiments with Vibe Coding, from small features to full applications. It seemed like almost anything could be built just by having a conversation with AI.

But a few months later, the mood shifted.

One user posted: *“Been vibe coding for 5 months, but went back no-code.”*

![Been vibe coding for 5 months, but went back no-code.](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/1-2y2mn5.png)

The reason was straightforward: the instability of AI-generated results (hallucinations). Debugging and fixing errors was exhausting, and long-term maintenance was even more daunting.

For many who tested Vibe Coding in real-world projects, the conclusion was clear: no-code remains the more stable and controllable option.

So maybe the real question isn’t *which one is better*, but *when to use each*.

## **How to Choose?**

I’m increasingly convinced that Vibe Coding won’t replace no-code. Instead, they’re more like two parallel paths—each with its own best use cases.

**Vibe Coding** works best for small, fast projects.

Think of a personal homepage, a simple utility, or a quick idea you want to bring to life—something that just needs to be generated quickly without complex logic.

**No-code** (beyond simple website builders) is better suited for complex, structured applications.

Examples include enterprise CRMs, approval systems, and data management platforms—apps that require collaboration, role-based permissions, data consistency, and long-term maintenance. In these scenarios, the stability and control that no-code platforms provide are critical.

What’s even more interesting is that the line between the two is blurring.

Many no-code platforms are now integrating AI features, allowing users to generate pages, fields, or workflows through natural language—while still retaining the consistency of a no-code framework.

So the real decision comes down to your project’s stage, the complexity of your requirements, and the resources of your team. These factors determine whether Vibe Coding, no-code, or a combination of both will be the right fit.

Next, I’ll recommend tools across three categories: Vibe Coding platforms, no-code platforms, and hybrid solutions that combine both.

## Vibe Coding

### **Cursor**

![Cursor](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/2-g9rzlq.PNG)

**Website:**[https://www.cursor.sh](https://www.cursor.sh)

**Overview**

Cursor is an IDE built specifically for the AI coding experience. It’s not just a wrapper around Copilot, but one of the flagship tools representing the “Vibe Coding” approach.

**Key Features**

* **Code-as-conversation workflow**: Cursor goes beyond simple autocomplete. You can highlight code blocks and directly edit them through conversation, generate commit messages, and even restructure architecture logic. Compared to Copilot, it feels more proactive and controllable.
* **Stronger context awareness**: Unlike VSCode plugins, Cursor captures project context more comprehensively. This makes it especially effective with long files or multi-module projects, where it can better understand overall structure.
* **Built-in version rollback**: Every AI-generated change automatically produces a diff, so you can roll back with a single click—reducing the risk of AI “hallucinations” breaking your code.
* **Reusable prompt marketplace**: Cursor is building a dedicated AI prompt marketplace, similar to VSCode snippets. Developers can reuse prompts crafted by others to improve AI output.

**Best Use Cases**

* Rapid prototyping to quickly test whether an idea is feasible (classic Vibe Coding use case).
* Refactoring or rewriting existing code, such as updating style components or APIs.
* A “sandbox” for exploring how far AI can assist in coding tasks.

**Limitations**

* **No self-hosting**: Not suitable for enterprises or privacy-sensitive projects requiring on-premise deployment.
* **Human judgment required**: While Cursor generates logically correct code, it won’t make architecture decisions or handle performance optimization for you.
* **Risk of skill gaps**: Heavy reliance on AI generation may turn developers into “prompt operators” rather than true system designers.

### **v0.app**

![v0.app](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/3-ntbi6k.png)

**Website:**[https://v0.dev](https://v0.dev)

**Key Features**

* **Streamlined “generate → publish” workflow**: Just describe your requirements—e.g., *“I need a home services website with a carousel banner”*—and Lovable automatically builds page layouts, text content, image styles, and even color schemes.
* **Optional AI Agents**: Beyond basic site generation, Lovable offers dozens of prebuilt AI agents such as *SEO Consultant*, *Design Assistant*, or *Copywriting Generator* to cover tasks outside of pure development.
* **Finished product delivery**: The goal isn’t to give you a dev environment, but a ready-to-use site. You can export the HTML/CSS/JS or host it directly.
* **Zero learning curve**: Designed for non-technical users, the experience is closer to “ChatGPT for websites” than a traditional builder.

**Best Use Cases**

* Early-stage startups validating ideas with a quick website or landing page (e.g., booking pages, blogs, event sites).
* Content-driven projects like portfolios, marketing pages, or course introductions.
* Freelancers and non-technical creators who want a smarter alternative to traditional site builders.

**Limitations**

* **AI-styled outputs**: Generated sites often carry a “templated” AI look in both design and copywriting—great for MVPs, but not ideal for polished brand websites.
* **No complex logic**: Lovable doesn’t support structured features like data modeling, permission control, or backend workflows, making it unsuitable for internal tools or system-level apps.
* **Bound by conversational scope**: Once requirements move beyond simple rules—like membership systems or dynamic forms—Lovable quickly hits its limits.

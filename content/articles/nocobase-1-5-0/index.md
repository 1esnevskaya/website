### Frontend Performance Optimizations

* Optimized initial screen load speed.
* Changed the frontend build tool to **rspack**.
* Reduced the bundle size of entry files for various plugin packages.
* Enhanced rendering performance for large data tables.
* Reduced stuttering during menu transitions.
* Introduced on-demand loading methods with the new `lazy` and `useLazy` libraries.

Below is a brief introduction to using `lazy` and `useLazy`:

```ts
import { lazy, useLazy } from '@nocobase/client';

// Export a single component:
const { RolesManagement } = lazy(() => import('./RolesManagement'), 'RolesManagement');

// Export multiple components:
const { AuthLayout, SignInPage, SignUpPage } = lazy(() => import('./pages'), 'AuthLayout', 'SignInPage', 'SignUpPage');

// Export a default component:
const ThemeList = lazy(() => import('./components/ThemeList'));

// Return a hook:
const useReactToPrint = useLazy<typeof import('react-to-print').useReactToPrint>(
  () => import('react-to-print'),
  'useReactToPrint',
);
  
// Return a library:
const parseExpression = useLazy<typeof import('cron-parser').parseExpression>(
  () => import('cron-parser'),
  'parseExpression',
);
```

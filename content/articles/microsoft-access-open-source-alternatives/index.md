On [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/brdev/comments/1h2s9tm/microsoft_acess/), one developer vividly described **the lifecycle of Microsoft Access** as below:

![](https://nocobase.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZjFjODIzZWZhMmQyOTEwYTY3NDc3M2Y4ZGJhOTdmMDFfZTRzZFowcjdGdXJmbDBScXFaT0NDcXJ1SDNYY0oxWGtfVG9rZW46Tm5udWJMdUdwbzdmUFF4b0ZBRmNvR3lVbkRmXzE3NTg4NzU3Mzg6MTc1ODg3OTMzOF9WNA)

This description neatly sums up how Access is often used in real-world businesses: starting as a convenient tool, then shared across teams, eventually running into corruption and performance bottlenecks, and finally being replaced by **more modern database solutions**.

As part of the Microsoft Office suite, Access is indeed easy to get started with. However, it has well-known limitations in performance, security, and scalability:

* **Limited performance**: The maximum size of a single database file is 2GB. Performance declines sharply with large datasets and high concurrency.
* **Weak security**: Database files can be easily copied, and password protection is not robust.
* **Poor scalability**: Difficult to scale alongside growing business needs.

These [issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/CAStateWorkers/comments/1k34y6z/do_you_use_microsoft_access/) are frequently mentioned by real users:

> Access files struggle with large datasets, prompting users to migrate to Power BI or other tools.

> In some organizations, Access survives as a legacy system. When problems arise, teams must fix them on their own because IT no longer supports Access.

> Some team members still use Access but find it outdated. Exporting large datasets is limited, and handling engineering-scale data becomes inefficient.

To overcome these limitations in performance, security, and scalability, more and more organizations are turning to modern **open source alternatives**.

These tools go beyond simple database management‚Äîthey also include no-code development platforms. They can replicate Access‚Äôs database functionality in some scenarios while providing stronger scalability, multi-user collaboration, and better security.

## Why is the Integration Capability of Low Code Platforms So Important?

As more businesses adopt low code (or no code) platforms to accelerate application development, **the integration capabilities of these platforms have become a crucial metric**.

A robust low code integration platform enables businesses to connect various data sources, enterprise applications, and cloud services without altering existing systems, ensuring smooth business processes.

Conversely, platforms with weak integration capabilities may hinder efficiency and even increase workload.

In this analysis, weâ€™ll explore the integration capabilities of several mainstream low code platforms, focusing on their performance in API interfaces, third-party service integration, and compatibility with enterprise-level systems.

Whether you are looking to integrate CRM systems, automate business processes, or unify multiple data sources, understanding the strengths of each platform will help you choose the best solution for your business needs.

* **Efficiently interact with existing systems for data and functionality exchange**
* **Meet enterprise-level security and permission management requirements**
* **Support complex business processes and real-time data handling**
* **Offer flexible scalability to adapt to future business changes**

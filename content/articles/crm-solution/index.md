## What If You Haven‚Äôt Purchased Commercial Plugins?

Even without commercial plugins, you can still build and run a fully functional CRM using NocoBase‚Äôs core features. Here‚Äôs how to handle some of the more advanced use cases:

1. **Complex Logic (e.g., Lead Assignment)**

If you don‚Äôt have access to features like pre-operation events, JSON parsing nodes, or JavaScript nodes, you can shift the logic into SQL stored procedures. This works, but it can make the codebase harder to manage and complicate future migrations.

2. **Change Tracking Without History Logs**

Without the history log plugin, you can approximate this functionality by combining pre-operation events, query nodes, and JavaScript nodes to compare field values. However, this method is manual, complex, and may affect performance‚Äîespecially for large datasets or frequent changes.

3. **Basic Commenting Without Specialized Blocks**

Missing features like the Comments plugin? You can recreate basic commenting using list views and Markdown fields. Check out this tutorial for an example:

üëâ [Using the Task Tutorial Plugin](https://www.nocobase.com/en/tutorials/task-tutorial-plugin-use)

While not as seamless, it covers most basic scenarios.

4. **Other Features**

Some capabilities‚Äîlike custom variable, template printing, or history logs‚Äîare difficult to replicate without the respective plugins. These may require significant custom development or workarounds.

## Copy It to Your Own Environment

You can copy the entire CRM system into your own NocoBase environment with just a few clicks. It‚Äôs a solid foundation to build on‚Äîadd, remove, or customize any features to fit your exact business needs.

Read the guide: [NocoBase CRM Demo Deployment Guide](https://www.nocobase.com/en/tutorials/nocobase-crm-demo-deployment-guide)

We‚Äôll also be publishing step-by-step tutorials that explain exactly how this CRM was built.

And this is just the start‚Äîmore ready-to-use solutions are on the way, including ticketing systems, project management tools, and more.

## Why choose a low-code platform?

Not all business development requires a low-code platform. If your project meets any of the following typical characteristics, you may consider it:

1. The business is in the exploration stage, and requirements change frequently, requiring developers to respond quickly.
2. There is not much time allocated to R&D, and the project needs to be delivered within a short period.
3. The project starts from scratch, and the development process is too long, with some parts being basic application functions.
4. There is not enough HC budget, or you want to reduce personnel costs.

If you meet any of these conditions, you can continue reading this article.

## How to Choose a Low-Code Platform?

### **Step 1: Collect and Analyze Requirements**

Collecting real and accurate requirements can help make better decisions. The users of the platform are not only developers themselves but also connect users in different business scenarios.

Generally, we can divide the requirements collection into three major categories: **business requirements, technical requirements, and user requirements**. Here are some common requirement scenarios for developers to refer to:

**Business Requirements**

* Improve market response speed: Quickly develop new products or services to respond to market changes.
* Promote business innovation: Provide a platform to test and implement new business models or services.
* Enhance customer experience: Quickly develop and deploy customer-facing applications to provide a better user experience and service.

**Technical Requirements**

* Seamless integration with existing systems: Integrate with the enterprise's existing ERP, CRM, and other systems seamlessly.
* Support for multi-platform deployment: Be able to support cloud deployment, on-premises deployment, or hybrid deployment to meet different technical strategies.
* Scalability: Easily expand the application's functionality and processing capacity as the business grows.

**User Requirements**

* Create and manage applications without deep programming knowledge: Enable non-technical personnel to participate in application development.
* Personalization and customization capabilities: Allow users to customize applications and workflows according to their business needs.
* Ease of use and intuitiveness: Provide an intuitive user interface and simple operation process to reduce the learning curve.

**Combining the demands of these three dimensions can help ensure that the selected platform not only meets current business needs but also adapts to future technological developments and user expectations.** For instance, choosing a low-code platform that can both accelerate time-to-market and integrate with existing systems, while being user-friendly for non-technical users, can maximize the overall efficiency and market competitiveness of the project.

### **Step 2: Research product capabilities for selection**

To accurately assess the capabilities of a low-code platform, you can start from these 5 points:

* **Functionality and flexibility**: Analyze the core functions provided by the platform, such as visual interfaces, automated processes, integration options, etc.
* **Scalability**: Consider whether the platform can expand as your business grows and changes, and whether it can integrate with third-party systems.
* **Security and compliance**: The platform's security and data protection, as well as how it supports compliance requirements.
* **Community and support**: Does the platform offer a developer community? How active is it? And does the platform provide efficient customer support services?
* **Cost-effectiveness**: Evaluate the expected overall cost of using the platform and the return on investment.

```Markdown
ROI Formula:
(Net Benefits - Costs) / Costs Ã— 100%

Net Benefits: Reduced labor costs, faster time-to-market, lower maintenance/outsourcing expenses.
Costs: Platform fees, implementation, training, and upgrades.
```

During the selection phase, developers can create a scoring table based on these 5 points, weight each evaluation item according to the requirements collected in the first step, and finally score to select a more suitable platform. The following provides a simple scoring template:


| **Platform** | **Functionality (30%)** | **Scalability (30%)** | **Security (20%)** | **Support (10%)** | **Cost (10%)** | **Total** |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| A            | 8                       | 7                     | 8                  | 9                 | 3              | 7.3       |
| B            | <br/>                   | <br/>                 | <br/>              | <br/>             | <br/>          | <br/>     |

### **Step 3: Trial or Project Pilot**

After screening several target platforms through scoring, you can move on to the trial and practical application stage. It is recommended to choose a real business project for the pilot, as the feedback will be more genuine. Finally, select the most suitable low-code development platform based on the final trial results.

## How to Successfully Implement a Low-Code Platform?

After the platform is selected, the implementation phase begins. If the selection stage is done well, the implementation will be much easier. Here are several key points to help developers smoothly complete the implementation of a low-code platform.

* **Provide Adequate Training and Resources**: Ensure team members receive necessary training and resources to fully utilize the low-code platform's features. This includes online courses, training sessions, and continuous technical support.
* **Progressive Deployment**: Start with small-scale projects and gradually expand the application scope of the low-code platform. This helps the organization adapt to the new tool step by step while reducing risks. For example, embed the functions developed with low-code into existing systems.
* **Establish a Continuous Feedback Mechanism**: Set up feedback channels to collect feedback from business users to continuously optimize and improve the use and management of the low-code platform. At the same time, internally share best practices, including the use of agile methods.
* **Ensure Data Governance and Security**: During the implementation process, strictly adhere to data governance and security standards to ensure that all applications developed and deployed comply with the organization's compliance requirements.
* **Monitor and Optimize**: Regularly monitor and evaluate the performance of the low-code platform and its developed applications to ensure they meet business needs and provide expected value.

## Avoid Common Traps in Low-Code Development!

By identifying and avoiding these common traps while choosing a low-code platform for development, developers can more effectively utilize low-code/no-code platforms, accelerate the development process, and ensure long-term sustainability and success.

1. **Over-reliance on Suppliers**

When choosing a platform, evaluate the supplier's market feedback, product roadmap, and exit strategy. Consider using platforms that support standard technologies and open APIs to reduce the risk of vendor lock-in.

2. **Ignoring User Experience**

From the early stages of the project, prioritize user experience. Conduct user research, design user-friendly logic, regularly collect user feedback, and optimize based on it.

3. **Accumulation of Technical Debt**

Even when using a low-code platform, follow good software development practices such as code reuse, modular design, and continuous integration. Regularly review and refactor code to manage and reduce technical debt.

4. **Lack of Long-term Perspective**

When choosing and implementing a low-code platform, consider the long-term technical and business strategies of the enterprise. Evaluate the platform's scalability, upgrade paths, and technical support to ensure it can support future growth and changes.

## Summary

In the selection and implementation of low-code or no-code platforms, the core lies in focusing on requirements. This article provides key actions at critical junctures and recommends several low-code platforms worth paying attention to, hoping to offer some ideas for developers who want to choose low-code or no-code platforms. We believe that as long as the correct methods are adopted, the platform can be fully utilized to accelerate the development process and achieve business goals more efficiently and at a lower cost.

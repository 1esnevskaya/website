## Why Are More People Seeking Airtable Alternatives?

In the past few years, Airtable has been one of the most popular collaborative database platforms, integrating spreadsheets, relational databases, and collaborative views for scenarios like project management, CRM, and process tracking. However, more teams are now reassessing Airtable‚Äôs long-term costs and flexibility‚Äîprimarily because **it‚Äôs getting increasingly expensive.**

According to [Airtable‚Äôs official announcement](https://support.airtable.com/docs/changes-to-airtable-plans), the platform overhauled its pricing tiers from the original Free/Plus/Pro/Enterprise to a new structure:

* **Free**: Basic features retained
* **Team**: \$20/month/person (annual billing) ‚Äî similar to the original Pro but with scaled-back features
* **Business**: \$45/month/person (annual) or \$54/month/person (monthly) ‚Äî full access to advanced features
* **Enterprise Scale**: Customized, supporting enterprise needs like SSO, permission management, and scalable APIs

![Airtable pricing](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/1-zbubpg.PNG)

The key change isn‚Äôt just pricing but **a restructuring of feature tiers**: many functions that Pro users relied on **were moved to the pricier Business plan**.

For a 10-person team aiming to maintain the same experience as the old Pro plan, this means annual costs could jump **from \$2,400 to \$5,400‚Äîa 125% increase**.

This doesn‚Äôt include ‚Äúhidden costs‚Äù from growing user counts, feature expansions, or upgrade plans.

üí¨ Hey, you're reading the NocoBase blog. NocoBase is an open-source no-code platform for building data apps, internal tools, and workflows‚Äîfully self-hosted, plugin-based, and developer-friendly.  ‚Üí[ Explore NocoBase on GitHub](https://github.com/nocobase/nocobase)

Many small-to-medium teams realize they only use basic features like tables, linked fields, and simple permissions. Advanced modules (e.g., dashboards, automation, embedded views) are either unused or restricted by pricing tiers. Tech companies, SaaS startups, and system integrators also prefer to control data permissions, deployment, and cost structures over relying on a closed SaaS tool.

**This has made self-hosted Airtable alternatives a trend.** They offer Airtable‚Äôs core collaborative experience plus:

* Lower long-term costs: One-time deployment for multiple users, no per-seat billing
* Stronger customization: Flexible plugins, permissions, and workflows for complex needs
* Higher data security: Support for private deployment, permission isolation, and compliance audits

* **NocoBase is the only tool not charging per user.** Its Standard plan costs \$800/year for 10‚Äì100 people, and Professional costs \$8,000‚Äîideal for mid-to-large organizations.
* **NocoDB‚Äôs Team plan starts at just \$228** but has limited features; the Business plan offers advanced functions at far lower costs than Airtable.
* **Teable, Rowy, and Baserow take a middle ground**: Airtable-like UIs with per-seat pricing, suitable for small-to-medium teams.
* Generally, self-hosted platforms that ‚Äúflatten pricing‚Äù across user counts are better for long-term team growth.

## Introduction

Professional IT Asset Management (ITAM) tools such as Lansweeper, AssetSonar, and Bluetally are already highly mature. So, why should we still consider using no-code tools to build an IT asset management system?

![ITAM.PNG](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/ITAM-84hmx5.PNG)

In environments with large-scale assets, strict compliance requirements, and a need to minimize manual maintenance, these dedicated ITAM tools are undoubtedly the best choice.

However, in reality, not every company is suited to adopt these platforms directly. For small to mid-sized businesses or teams with unique business workflows, a **flexible**, **low-cost**, and **fast-to-deploy** solution can be more practical.

This is where **no-code platforms** offer real value: although they may lack some of the advanced automation features of professional ITAM tools, they excel in **simplicity** and **high customizability**. They allow you to **adapt asset management to your specific workflows** and integrate it seamlessly into daily business operations.

## Core Features of a No-Code ITAM System

After understanding the role of no-code platforms in ITAM, the next question is: What core features can they cover?

Although most no-code solutions cannot provide built-in automated asset discovery like professional ITAM products (some allow third-party integrations), they are powerful enough to handle everyday asset management for most organizations.

Hereâ€™s a typical feature checklist:

* **Asset Registry** â€“ Centralized management of all IT assets, including hardware, software, licenses, and contracts, reducing data silos across spreadsheets and systems.
* **Lifecycle Management** â€“ Track every stage from procurement to allocation, maintenance, and retirement, ensuring full visibility into asset usage.
* **User & Access Control** â€“ Assign asset owners and users clearly, while restricting access based on roles and responsibilities.
* **License & Contract Tracking** â€“ Avoid missed renewals or expirations, reduce compliance risks, and control extra costs.
* **Reporting & Analytics** â€“ Create customized dashboards and reports to monitor utilization, costs, and depreciation, supporting better decision-making.
* **Automation** â€“ Use workflows to trigger actions automatically, such as sending renewal reminders, generating work orders, or approving requests.

If your team currently manages IT assets using Excel or Google Sheets, switching to a no-code platform can be an ideal transitional step.

Moreover, many platforms support extended customization, such as:

* Integrating with third-party tools for **network scanning**
* Connecting with finance systems for **cost tracking**
* Enabling **mobile asset registration** with barcode scanning

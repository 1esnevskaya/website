In today's digital enterprises, "data silos" remain a pervasive challenge. A single customer may have records in CRM, support tickets in the helpdesk system, and transactions in the payment gateway—but these data points often exist in isolation, making it impossible to drive automated actions or gain unified insights. Many organizations resort to manual Excel exports, custom scripts, or system-by-system integrations just to facilitate basic business workflows.

**This fragmentation of data has become one of the biggest hurdles to digital transformation.**

This is where **Data Integration Platforms** come in. Their core value lies in connecting internal and external systems, ensuring data flows to the right place, at the right time, and in the right format. Based on different use cases, these platforms can be categorized into three main types:

* **Low-Code Platforms** that combine data integration with application building, ideal for lightweight business systems.
* **ETL Tools** focused on data warehousing, emphasizing efficient and reliable data movement.
* **No-Code iPaaS Tools** for automation, designed to connect disparate business processes.

Below, we've curated 7 top data integration platforms across these three categories:

## 1. Data Model-Driven Application Platforms

**Best for**: Building business systems with forms, data views, and permission controls.

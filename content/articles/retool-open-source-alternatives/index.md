Open-source alternatives usually allow complete control over every aspect of the system, whether it is the code, data, or other elements. By using open-source alternatives, companies have full control over all system details and can freely adjust and customize the system to meet their specific business needs.

**Flexibility**

Retool emphasizes flexibility for developers, allowing users to extend application functionality by writing JavaScript, SQL, and Python. It also offers a rich set of pre-built components to simplify routine development tasks.

However, for enterprises requiring deeper customization and integration, Retool‚Äôs closed-source nature may limit its usage in complex scenarios. In contrast, open-source alternatives offer greater extensibility, as companies can directly modify the code to fit their complex business logic and requirements.

**No Subscription Fees**

Retool‚Äôs SaaS version operates on a subscription model, with prices depending on the number of users and the required features. For example, its standard version starts at \$10 per user per month, while enterprise features (such as self-hosting and enhanced security controls) require customized pricing. This subscription model is suitable for teams looking for quick deployment, but as a company scales, subscription costs can increase significantly.

In contrast, open-source alternatives usually do not have subscription fees, with businesses only covering hosting and maintenance costs. This makes open-source alternatives more advantageous for long-term cost control, especially for larger companies or development teams.

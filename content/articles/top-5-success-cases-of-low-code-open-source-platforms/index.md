#### **UUL**

![UUL.PNG](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/72a1e17616382142a051e0d9f7b5c6b1.PNG)

* **Industry**: Logistics
* **Scale**: Medium-sized enterprise

#### **Challenges**

UUL is facing a severe test of the data system's processing capacity due to the diversity and complexity of business. Existing integration solutions are gradually revealing their drawbacks: software systems often lag behind business needs, and the cost of collaboration across departments and businesses is rising sharply. The best business practices are highly bound to individual employee experience, making it difficult to promote within the entire group, which greatly limits the scale development.

There is an urgent need for a comprehensive supply chain logistics delivery system, which not only includes OA, CRM, and FMS, but also needs to integrate multiple business operation modules such as WMS, TMS, CDS, OMS, and customer service support systems to meet the needs for efficient management and flexible response.

#### Solutions

The low-code platform provided by NocoBase enables UUL to quickly upgrade their logistics system. NocoBase enables flexible and intuitive interface design based on data models, allowing users to receive clear and immediate feedback when interacting with data.

In this collaborative project, UUL contributed expertise and knowledge in the logistics industry. Yuqi Tech was responsible for data modeling and user interface design, while NocoBase provided infrastructure support. This project structure facilitated the efficient and flexible development of the logistics delivery system.

![Logistics Delivery Syetem.PNG](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/04bb084d7b0967862b9d91d0ee7df7ad.PNG)

Delivering digital management systems in this collaborative mode greatly improved delivery speed and significantly reduced costs to a lower magnitude.

It is attributed to the excellent system design logic of NocoBase:

* **Model-driven Logic**: Once the data model is defined at an early stage, building the page later becomes much more straightforward.
* **Function as a Plugin**: NocoBase‚Äôs architectural design allows developers to develop new plugins that adopt new requirements and can be reused.

#### **Customer Feedback**

> Zhang Zhuo shared:
>
> ‚ÄúAs an experienced NocoBase user, I can build a page in just 3 minutes. Once I establish the model based on data standards and configure the fields, I can set up the UI on the configuration page to develop the system. While going through business processes and integrating complex back-end functions may take longer, creating a functional page in NocoBase is generally quick. For example, our team can implement a small content management system or product center within a week. ‚Äù

#### **Challenges**

In an era marked by digital advancements, SSI recognized the need to refine its customer relationship management practices. This journey led to a partnership with International Distribution Corporation (IDB), a pioneer in developing and operating VoIP Systems for a diverse range of industries. Together, they embarked on a strategic initiative to consolidate SSI‚Äôs fragmented customer service framework using the Joget open-source enterprise no-code/low-code platform.

The path to digital transformation is often fraught with challenges, and for SSI, the journey was no different. The company‚Äôs legacy systems, restricted to computer use, were not only slow but also posed risks to customer information security and were cumbersome when adapting to new procedures or creating varied customer request forms. This fragmentation led to delayed responses to customer inquiries, inconsistent resolution of customer tickets, and significant difficulties in managing and securing customer data.

Furthermore, the scattered support and resolution forms across multiple applications made it challenging for users to track their requests, resulting in fragmented data and inefficiencies in customer request management.

#### **Solutions**

Recognizing the need for change, SSI, in collaboration with IDB, embarked on a transformative project to develop a CRM support system using the Joget platform. This innovative solution was designed to address the pressing challenges head-on, enabling seamless customer onboarding and communication across phone, email, and chat channels.

**Implemented within a mere two months,** the system redefined how SSI managed customer relationships by providing a unified platform for interaction, engagement, and data management.

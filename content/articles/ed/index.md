## **Intro**

> A fun fact from our journey: in our pre-sales process, we often combine NocoBase with AI to deliver proof-of-concepts at record speed. Clients are frequently surprised when, after meeting us on Monday, they return on Wednesday to see a fully working prototype. The usual reaction is: *“What’s the magic?”* When we reveal NocoBase, it always creates a moment of surprise—and curiosity.

## **About ED**

[ED](https://ed.dev.br/) is a Brazil-based technology company with **more than 130 professionals across 16 states**. For years, the team has delivered and supported mission-critical systems for large enterprises in insurance, capital markets, utilities, and the public sector.

![ED.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/ED-nvmw2z.png)

On the delivery side, ED holds **ISO 9001** certification (covering software, project, and infrastructure management processes) and has achieved **CMMI-DEV Level 3**, reflecting internationally recognized standards and sustainable engineering maturity.

Organizationally, ED has been ranked in Brazil’s “Great Place to Work” Top 10 for four consecutive years—peaking at No. 1 and currently holding No. 6. This recognition highlights ED’s ability to attract and retain top talent, ensuring professionalism and stability in every project.

With its scale, rigorous quality systems, and broad customer base, ED is recognized as a leading enterprise technology service provider in Brazil. Today, it is accelerating efforts in **modern platforms and AI-driven solutions** to help clients prepare for the future.

## **Pain Points and Decision**

In daily project delivery, ED’s engineering team repeatedly faced the same challenge: **endless cycles of CRUD and integration development**. Whether for internal systems or client-facing projects, they needed to quickly build data management layers, generate APIs, handle import/export, and still ensure security and scalability. Each time meant starting from scratch—consuming significant time and resources, and ultimately slowing down innovation.

To break out of this cycle, ED compiled **an enterprise-grade requirements checklist**:

* **Security** — access control, data isolation, compliance assurance
* **Performance** — fast response times even under large-scale datasets
* **Scalability** — flexible adaptation across diverse projects and client environments
* **Observability** — transparent operations for monitoring and troubleshooting

What they needed was more than just a table-dragging tool. They were looking for a platform that could support complete data models, enforce strong types and relational structures, and automatically generate APIs.

After evaluating multiple market solutions, ED ultimately chose **NocoBase**. Internal proof-of-concepts showed that NocoBase not only met every item on their checklist but also delivered greater flexibility and efficiency in real-world use.

## **Implementation Scenarios**

After completing the proof of concept, ED quickly rolled out NocoBase into its core business systems and gradually extended it to multiple scenarios.

### **Scenario 1: Commercial Product – [AssistFlow](https://assistflow.com.br/)**

Unlike most companies that only use NocoBase for internal systems, ED built an external commercial platform directly on it—**[AssistFlow](https://assistflow.com.br/)**. AssistFlow enables enterprises to rapidly create intelligent agents that run seamlessly across multiple social media channels, supporting multimodal interactions with text, voice, images, and files. Beyond customer service, it also extends to sales, HR, technical support, and more.

In this commercial product, the entire configuration module and management interface are powered by NocoBase. This means the team doesn’t need to redevelop frontend logic; instead, they can model and configure directly in NocoBase to provide customers with flexible and scalable management capabilities.

**AssistFlow Highlights:**

* **Fast onboarding** — Create and launch an intelligent agent in just 5 minutes, no coding required
* **Multi-channel integration** — Supports WhatsApp, Teams, Slack, Telegram, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and more
* **Multimodal interaction** — Handles text, voice, images, and files to meet diverse business needs
* **Wide applicability** — Covers customer service, sales, marketing, HR, and technical support
* **Automation and integration** — Built-in APIs enable seamless connections with existing systems and streamline workflows
* **Secure and controllable** — Supports private cloud deployment to meet enterprise-grade security and compliance requirements

### **Scenario 2: Project Management Platform**

Built to support the full lifecycle of ED’s client delivery projects. Tasks that once required multiple rounds of development—such as CRUD operations and permission logic—can now be completed in a single step through simple data modeling, frontend configuration, and auto-generated APIs.

### **Scenario 3: Ticketing System**

An external-facing support and service request system fully powered by NocoBase’s data layer and interface. Customers can submit and track tickets directly, while backend workflows are automatically triggered to handle each request.

### **Scenario 4: Vendor Management System**

In this system, vendors can upload invoices, which automatically trigger payment approval workflows. With NocoBase’s data modeling and workflow capabilities, the entire process is automated and fully traceable.

## **Results**

With NocoBase, ED achieved significant improvements in both delivery speed and quality:

* **Shorter delivery cycles** — Modules that previously required 2–3 iterations of 15 days each can now be completed in just one iteration
* **Faster testing and launch** — Most features only require direct functional testing, without the complex layers typical of traditional development
* **Greater production stability** — Smoother go-lives and stronger team confidence

Engineers at ED believe NocoBase has transformed the way they build. Visual modeling, automated CRUD, flexible workflows, and auto-generated APIs have freed developers from repetitive work, allowing them to focus directly on business outcomes. QA and user feedback loops have become much shorter, enabling projects to reach production faster.

Today, NocoBase has become ED’s technology backbone: powering internal systems, forming the foundation of external commercial products, and supporting nearly all day-to-day delivery. More importantly, this “Monday meeting, Wednesday prototype” magic is not only the starting point of customer surprise and trust—it also represents a new paradigm of delivery.

## **Outlook**

For technology teams worldwide, ED’s experience shows that NocoBase not only meets enterprise-grade requirements—security, performance, scalability, and observability—but also enables faster iterations, shifting focus from repetitive tasks to innovation and value creation.

In Brazil, ED has already reshaped its delivery model with NocoBase. Next, they aim to bring this approach to more industries and organizations together with NocoBase.

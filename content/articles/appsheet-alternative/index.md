## Background

A few days ago, I came across [this post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nocode/comments/1iwcsrf/comment/miefglw/?context=3):

> *‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for a low/no-code platform for project management that supports many-to-many relationships between contacts, projects, and tasks. AppSheet feels clunky when viewing data. I‚Äôve tried Bubble and Clappia, but they don‚Äôt seem to support many-to-many relationships.‚Äù*

Here‚Äôs a summary of the user's **core requirements**:

- **Many-to-Many Relationships**: One contact can be part of multiple projects; each project may involve multiple contacts and tasks.
- **Project & Task Management**: Ability to track task status, assign team members, and set up automation workflows.
- **File Upload & Visual Interface**: Needs a more intuitive and visual way to view related data‚Äînot just spreadsheet-style tables.

**Since none of the platforms this user tried could fully meet these needs, they reached out to the community for help.**

## Why Most No-Code Platforms Struggle with Complex Data Relationships?

Most no-code tools like AppSheet, Bubble, Clappia, Airtable, or NocoDB rely on a **spreadsheet-like data structure**, where data is stored in **single tables or form-based views**. This works well for simple applications, but when it comes to managing complex relationships, things start to break down.

Common limitations include:

‚ùå **Hard to Model Complex Relationships**

Most platforms only support single-direction references or nested lists. To create a many-to-many structure (e.g., contacts ‚Üî projects), users must manually set up intermediate tables, which adds complexity.

‚ùå **Complicated Queries and Filtering**

Platforms like Bubble and Clappia require manual configuration of list fields and complex filtering logic just to reflect real-world many-to-many relationships.

‚ùå **Limited Automation**

Automations in tools like AppSheet are typically triggered by form submissions and can't easily span multiple tables or conditional workflows.

‚ùå **Lack of Visual Context**

Many no-code platforms rely on static table views. Viewing a project's full context‚Äîincluding related contacts, tasks, and documents‚Äîoften requires navigating between multiple pages or setting up custom reports.

That‚Äôs why many users (like the one from Reddit) eventually look for a more flexible alternative‚Äîespecially when managing many-to-many data models and process automation.

## How to Solve These Problems?

Let‚Äôs walk through how to build this kind of system using [**NocoBase**](https://www.nocobase.com), an open-source no-code platform that supports structured data modeling, many-to-many relationships, and automation workflows‚Äîall without writing a line of code.

### 1. Build Many-to-Many Relationships: Linking Contacts and Projects

With NocoBase, you can **define many-to-many relationships directly in the data model**, no extra join tables or complex logic needed.

**Step 1**: Create two tables: `Contacts` and `Projects`.

![Contacts.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/b437b1a0213d73eef98ae92ec1646296.png)

**Step 2**: Add a **many-to-many field** in the `Projects` table that links to `Contacts`.

**Step 3**: On the UI, add a block to display this relation‚Äîyour users can now view related contacts directly on the project page, no page-hopping required.

### 2. Automate Workflows: Status Updates & Notifications

Unlike most platforms where automation is limited to form actions, NocoBase allows **event-based triggers** across different tables.

**Example**: When a team member completes a task, update the task status and notify the relevant project owner.

- **Trigger**: Task status changes to ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù
- **Action**: Send a notification and update the view accordingly

Workflow Configuration Interface:

This is a simple but common workflow. With NocoBase, you can customize far more complex automations without code.

### 3. Rich Visual Display & File Uploads

NocoBase offers multiple ways to display data visually:

**Table View**: Like Excel, but fully supports relationships.

**Kanban View**: Manage tasks by status, like Trello.

**Gantt Chart**: Visualize project timelines and dependencies.

Need to manage documents? Just add a custom file field and upload any attachment.

About a month ago, I came across a highly discussed post on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44450160) ‚Äî ‚Äú[Stop Building AI Agents](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/stop-building-ai-agents)‚Äù

![Stop Building AI Agents](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/1-472k2u.png)

In the post, the author shared a personal experience: he built a "research crew" with CrewAI: three agents, five tools, perfect coordination on paper. But in practice, the researcher ignored the web scraper, the summarizer forgot to use the citation tool and the coordinator gave up entirely when processing longer documents. It was a beautiful plan falling apart in spectacular ways.

The flowchart below was created by the author after countless rounds of debugging and failed attempts, summarizing his decision guide for **Should I use an Agent**.

![Should I use an Agent](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/2-45bvv4.png)

Image source: https://decodingml.substack.com/p/stop-building-ai-agents

The article distilled an important principle: **agents work best in unstable processes where humans remain in the loop for oversight** ‚Äî in these scenarios, an agent‚Äôs exploratory and creative capabilities often outperform a rigid workflow.

* **Recommended scenarios:** data science assistant (auto-generating SQL, creating visualizations, exploring data trends); creative writing partner (brainstorming ideas, refining copy); code refactoring assistant (suggesting optimizations, detecting potential issues). In these cases, humans can continuously evaluate results and correct deviations.
* **Not recommended for:** mission-critical enterprise automation (key business processes that cannot risk instability from LLM-driven decisions); high-stakes decision-making (finance, medical diagnosis, legal compliance ‚Äî areas that require deterministic logic).

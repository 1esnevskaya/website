Over a month ago, we published an article titled "[The Ultimate Guide to Awesome Self-Hosted Solutions](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-awesome-self-hosted-solutions)". In that piece, we explored the comparison between cloud services and self-hosted solutions, the potential challenges of self-hosting, how to choose the right self-hosted solution, and introduced five outstanding self-hosted products for various scenarios.

We won't go into the advantages of self-hosting again here. Instead, today, we will dive into some of the best self-hosted projects on GitHub!

From [GitHub's self-hosted topic](https://github.com/topics/self-hosted), we have selected the top 13 projects with the highest number of stars. These projects not only have mature technology but also an active community to provide strong support.

This list is ordered by the number of stars on GitHub and is curated to bring some of the best projects to your attention.

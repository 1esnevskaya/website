NocoBase was released on GitHub in March 2021, and after three years of community development, version 1.0 was launched on April 28, 2024, officially offering commercial editions and services. In the 11 months since version 1.0, we have released a total of 229 versions across the Main, Beta, and Alpha branches, securing commercial licenses from nearly 200 companies in 32 countries worldwide. As an open-source product, these commercial clients have provided us with the foundation for survival and are crucial to our continued development. With the support of these users, we have achieved a state of stable profitability.

We plan to release NocoBase 2.0 soon, which will include significant features such as AI employees. To thank these nearly 200 commercial clients and to enable more users to access NocoBase's advanced features at a lower cost, we have decided to reduce the pricing of commercial plugins and increase the benefits of commercial editions.

### The adjustments to [commercial plugins ](https://www.nocobase.com/en/plugins-commercial)are as follows:

* Some plugins will be changed from commercial to free. For example: Workflow - Response Message Node, Departments.

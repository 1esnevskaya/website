## Background

In a course titled “Application Development with Low-Code Platforms” at a technical university in Germany, the instructor wanted students to go beyond theory and build real applications. The course used several low/no-code tools, with [NocoBase](http:www.nocobase.com/ "NocoBase") as the primary hands-on example.

## Quick Start: Task Management in the First Session

On day one, students jumped straight into practice: following NocoBase’s getting-started tutorial to build a task management app. Within a single class, they learned the basics of data modeling and UI configuration, and experienced **how quickly a low-code platform enables rapid prototyping**.

## Deep Dive: Re-implementing Salesforce Modules

In later sessions, students used NocoBase to re-implement core Salesforce modules:

* Contacts
* Leads
* Opportunities
* Customer Management


  This exercise taught them how to **design data structures and business logic in NocoBase**, while comparing its feature depth, extensibility, and limitations against Salesforce. The course also included Appsmith and Microsoft Power Apps for a side-by-side comparison of strengths and trade-offs across platforms.

  ## Project Work: A Low-Code Application Manager

  For a three-week project phase, the instructor built **a Low-Code Application Manager in NocoBase** to support the class. Within this system, students could:

1. Register the requirements their apps aim to solve
2. Configure data sources (tables or collections)
3. Manage app pages
4. Design and implement business-logic patterns


   On the instructor side, the system provided a consolidated view of all projects, plus grading and commenting workflows for feedback. **It served both as a teaching management tool and a project knowledge base**.

   ## Experience and Feedback

   The instructor reported positively on NocoBase in class:

* **Stability**: Ran smoothly across multiple sessions and projects.
* **Architecture**: Flexible data modeling and a plugin-based design made the coursework easy to extend.

> “Overall, I’m very satisfied with the platform and appreciate its design and stability.”
> — Professor, Technical University in Germany

Last year, as the number of NocoBase users grew, we faced a pressing challenge: **how to efficiently manage customer feedback and support requests**.

Users reached out via emails, community forums, and even through internal colleagues. With information scattered across multiple channels, issues were easily missed, and collaboration on follow-ups became cumbersome. We realized it was time to implement a ticketing system tailored to our workflows.

So, we decided to build our own custom ticketing system using NocoBase.

During this process, we tested several open-source projects and identified some excellent tools, while also defining **the core features essential for an effective ticketing system**.

![Ticketing Systems](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Frame%2073%20(1)-nwwjl2.png)

A truly effective ticketing system must go beyond mere "recording" and **support continuous follow-ups, team collaboration, and process transparency**. These are the non-negotiable features we identified:

* **Data Integration**: Linking user information with business context. A ticketing system that can’t associate tickets with user profiles, historical interactions, or orders makes issue resolution slow and inefficient. Ideally, it should integrate seamlessly with internal systems like CRM, ERP, etc., to pull in user data, order records, and usage patterns—reducing manual data entry and improving response times.
* **Clear Accountability & Status Tracking**: Each ticket should have an assigned owner, priority level, and support status transitions (e.g., "Pending," "In Progress," "Resolved") to keep the team aligned on progress.
* **Internal Collaboration**: The ability for team members to discuss tickets, add private notes, and share updates in one place, eliminating fragmented communication.
* **Customizable Templates & Forms**: Different ticket types (e.g., technical support, account issues, product feedback) require unique fields and workflows to adapt to diverse business needs.
* **Advanced Tagging & Filtering**: As ticket volumes grow, robust search, tagging, and filtering capabilities are crucial for quick issue triaging and data-driven optimization.

This article shares our top 6 recommended open-source ticketing systems. Here’s why open-source solutions stand out:

* **Cost-Effective**: No subscription fees, ideal for long-term use.
* **Data Control**: Self-hosted solutions ensure data security and compliance.
* **Flexible Customization**: Open-source code allows deep customization to match unique workflows.

Why combine ERP and CRM into one list?

In practice, ERP and CRM are frequently discussed together in enterprise management. Many teams realize that deploying either ERP or CRM alone isn't sufficient to digitize their entire workflow. Indeed, many open-source projects now integrate features from both:

* ERP systems incorporate CRM capabilities, managing processes from lead generation to sales.
* CRM systems enhance functionality with ERP features like inventory management, orders, and financial modules.

By merging these two areas into one guide, we help you identify robust, reputable, and integrated open-source management solutions, simplifying your selection process.

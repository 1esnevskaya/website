## OutSystems' Hidden Costs Go Beyond Money

OutSystems is a leader in enterprise low-code development. By deeply integrating generative AI tools into the software lifecycle, OutSystems empowers enterprises to rapidly build customer-oriented portals, customized core systems, and efficiency-boosting internal tools, establishing itself as a benchmark in enterprise application development.

However, despite OutSystems' technical prowess, more enterprises are turning to open-source alternatives. When choosing OutSystems, companies often underestimate the long-term costs of closed-source low-code platforms.

## **Four Core Pain Points from User Feedback**

1. **Steep Learning Curve**

While OutSystems' basic features are easy to use, advanced functionalities require certified developers. [Users report](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/multiexperience-development-platforms/vendor/outsystems/product/outsystems-platform) that complex system integrations demand lengthy learning cycles. Limited community and third-party support mean users must rely primarily on official assistance when encountering issues.

2. **Closed Technology Stack**

OutSystems employs a proprietary development architecture and dedicated language system. While visual interfaces lower initial barriers, they ultimately trap enterprises in closed ecosystems. Developers‚Äô acquired skills aren‚Äôt transferable, and technological evolution depends entirely on vendor updates.

3. **Limited Functional Extensions**

Despite offering rich pre-built components, OutSystems' closed-source nature restricts deep customization. Enterprises cannot move beyond official connectors and API management frameworks when implementing non-standard business logic.

4. **High Ownership Costs**

OutSystems‚Äô pricing is steep, especially for small businesses. Complex licensing models with user/object-based fees make even small projects budget-challenging.

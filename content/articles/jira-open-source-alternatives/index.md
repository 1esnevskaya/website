> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see anyone who actually likes Jira.‚Äù

Recently, a [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ju81cr/jira_is_it_still_helping_teams_or_just_slowing/) thread about **[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)** sparked heated discussions among developers. Many shared their frustrations and struggles when using the platform.

Launched by [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) in 2002, Jira started as a bug-tracking tool specifically designed for software development teams. Over the years, as agile methodologies gained popularity, Jira evolved into a full-fledged project management and collaboration platform ‚Äî supporting Scrum, Kanban, task assignment, version control, reporting, and more. It gradually became the go-to choice for development teams worldwide.

* Custom workflows spiral out of control

* Search that requires sorcery

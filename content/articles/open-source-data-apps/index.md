## Introduction

For developers, one of the most common needs at work is to quickly build a data application.

It could be an operations dashboard, an internal query tool, or a simple customer data portal.

Traditionally, you'd have to write a backend, connect to a database, and then build the frontend.

Fortunately, today we have **excellent open-source tools** that allow you to build production-ready data applications within hours.

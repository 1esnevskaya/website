The term MCP truly gained widespread attention in early 2025, especially within the AI tool development community.

In March, a heated debate about ‚ÄúMCP - flash in the pan or future standard?‚Äù ignited the discussion. Core members from LangChain and LangGraph clashed intensely on X, and MCP-related projects on GitHub started trending one after another.

**Why is MCP gaining popularity?**

At its core, developers have finally realized this: ChatGPT can generate content but can‚Äôt automatically fetch web pages; Claude can understand PDFs but cannot call APIs. Although the models are powerful, they lack a closed execution loop, and tool integration remains a bottleneck.

MCP aims to solve this‚Äúlast mile‚Äùproblem. It acts like a USB-C port for models, helping AI unify access to browsers, databases, plugin systems, and more, enabling models not just to talk but to take action.

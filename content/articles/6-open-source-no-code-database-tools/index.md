## Introduction

If you‚Äôve used Airtable or Notion, you probably feel the same way I do: they‚Äôre far more convenient than traditional spreadsheets like Excel or Google Sheets.

Our team mainly uses NocoBase (yes, our own product) for internal business process management, but I still rely on Notion for certain personal tasks‚Äîlike planning blog content for NocoBase.

Airtable and Notion are excellent for lightweight, flexible scenarios. But once you start using them in long-term, multi-user projects, you‚Äôll inevitably hit a limitation: **data caps**.

(We‚Äôve previously written about this: [Airtable Data Limit Reached: 3 Common Solutions](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/airtable-data-limit-reached-3-common-solutions).

So the community has been asking: *Is there an open-source no-code database tool that‚Äôs as easy to use as Airtable, but with the flexibility of a database?*

The answer: **Yes‚Äîand they‚Äôre getting better every year**.

In this article, I‚Äôll introduce several free, open-source tools, focusing on three key questions:

* How much data does the free version support?
* What‚Äôs different between open-source and commercial editions?
* Which tools are best for team deployment and long-term use?

Whether you‚Äôre an individual developer or selecting tools for a team, this should give you a clear starting point.

## 1. NocoBase

* **GitHub:** [https://github.com/nocobase/nocobase](https://github.com/nocobase/nocobase)
* **Website:** [https://www.nocobase.com](https://www.nocobase.com/)
* **Stars:** 16.3k
* **Contributors:** 94
* **Activity:** Updated almost daily, active community

**Overview** NocoBase is an open-source no-code platform for mid-to-high complexity business systems. Its core concept: *data modeling drives application building*.

Compared to Airtable, NocoBase offers a full modeling system: define fields, views, and relationships; configure user permissions; set up workflows; design page layouts; and extend via plugins.

Think of it as **‚Äúdatabase + permissions + frontend + workflows + plugins‚Äù**‚Äîa full-stack no-code framework.

| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Free                | 100        | 2                |
| Starter             | 10,000     | Per-user pricing |

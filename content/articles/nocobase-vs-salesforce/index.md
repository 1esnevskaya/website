This is our fourth product comparison article.

Today, we’ll explore two CRM tools—[NocoBase](https://www.nocobase.com/en/) and Salesforce—that differ widely in functionality, use cases, and pricing. If you’re in the market for an efficient and tailored customer relationship management system for your team, this article may offer valuable insights.

Salesforce, as the leading name in the CRM market, is widely adopted by medium and large enterprises for its robust SaaS platform and comprehensive features. However, its powerful capabilities come with a steep price: the Enterprise edition costs \$165 per user per month, while the Unlimited edition reaches \$330. **For a 10-person team, the first year’s subscription costs alone would total \$19,800.**

NocoBase, on the other hand, offers a more budget-friendly and flexible pricing model. The Standard edition has a one-time fee of \$800, the Professional edition is \$8,000, and the Enterprise edition is custom-priced to fit specific needs. This approach provides cost-conscious businesses with a more controllable and value-driven CRM solution.


| Team Size | NocoBase                                                | Salesforce                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 10        | Standard Version:\$800 (one-time)                       | \$19,800/year\~\$39,600/year     |
| 100       | Professional:\$8,000 (one-time)                         | \$198,000/year\~\$396,000/year   |
| 500       | Enterprise Edition (estimated one-time cost\~\$50,000+) | \$990,000/year\~\$1,980,000/year |

The pricing differences highlight the distinct positioning and use cases of these two products:

* Salesforce is ideal for medium and large enterprises that prioritize stability and proven solutions, particularly those seeking a robust ecosystem to enhance customer management.
* NocoBase is perfect for businesses that need deep customization and flexibility, especially for technical teams requiring complete control over their data and the ability to respond quickly to evolving business needs.

In the next sections, we’ll break down the two products across key dimensions, including features and user experience, to help you decide which CRM best suits your needs.

For customer support, Salesforce includes advanced case management tools, enabling businesses to resolve customer issues quickly and efficiently. Features like knowledge bases, automated ticket assignment, and SLA tracking empower teams to collaborate seamlessly and deliver exceptional service.

While Salesforce’s standardized solutions are ideal for rapid deployment, businesses with more complex workflows or advanced customization needs may require additional development or third-party tools, which could reduce overall flexibility.

### **Database**

The database is a crucial element of any CRM system, shaping how businesses store, manage, and scale their data. Whether it’s customer information, sales records, or operational data, a strong database ensures security, accessibility, and adaptability, providing the foundation for informed decision-making.

#### NocoBase's Database Capabilities

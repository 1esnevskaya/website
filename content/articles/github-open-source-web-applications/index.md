Over the past few weeks, we’ve shared several popular GitHub collections featuring the most-starred open source projects—and they’ve received tons of likes and bookmarks. Many developers asked us to cover more categories, and we’re happy to continue the series.

Some of our previous lists include:

* [Top 40 Open-source Developer Tools with the Most GitHub Stars](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/github-open-source-developer-tools)
* [Top 15 Fastest-Growing Open-Source Low-Code Projects on GitHub in 2025](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/github-top15-fastest-growing-open-source-low-code-projects)
* [Top 11 Open-source CRM Projects with the Most GitHub Stars](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/github-open-source-crm-projects)
* [Top 11 Open-Source Admin Dashboard Projects on GitHub](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/top-11-open-source-admin-dashboard-projects-on-github)

In this post, we’re focusing on **Web Applications**. We searched through the [web-application](https://github.com/topics/web-application) and [web-app](https://github.com/topics/web-app) GitHub topics, and picked projects with **over 10,000 stars** and a clear use case. These include platforms for publishing, data visualization, low-code app building, and more.

To help you quickly understand and evaluate each project, we’ve broken down the analysis into three simple parts:

* **What it does** – What problem does the project solve, and who is it for?
* **How to use it** – Is it easy to deploy and test?
* **How it’s built** – What’s the tech stack, and is it easy to extend or learn from?

If you’re new to web development or looking for tools that can speed up your workflow, check out this beginner-friendly guide we published earlier:

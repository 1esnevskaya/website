## Best Open Source Projects for Building Internal Tools

There are many internal tools on the market, with lots of them being cloud products. While cloud products are easy to use, they bring two issues:

1. High costs as users increase;
2. Lack of data control.

So, today we'll look at the best open source projects on GitHub for building internal tools. The open source versions are free and can meet most needs of small to medium startups, schools, or nonprofits. Also, self-hosting internal tools gives companies full control over their data.

**This list will only share internal tool projects on GitHub with over 10,000 stars.**

I hope this list helps you build internal tools better, faster, and cheaper!

### **Tool 1: NocoBase**

#### Info

**No-code / Low-code**

**GitHub Project Start Date**: 2021

**Related Resources:**[Website](https://www.nocobase.com/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/nocobase/nocobase) | [Docs](https://docs.nocobase.com/)

NocoBase is an open-source no-code/low-code platform made for building internal tools, business apps, and company solutions. NocoBase helps businesses quickly set up custom business apps like CRM, PM tools, and other business process management solutions without spending a lot of time and money on software development.

Here's a real-world example: Let's say your company needs to quickly build a custom inventory management system to track stock in different warehouses.

In NocoBase, you'd first set up the needed database, tables, and fields, defining key details for inventory items like product name, quantity, and warehouse location. Next, using its WYSIWYG UI design interface, you'd build an easy-to-use interface linked to your data model by dragging and dropping blocks like tables, charts, and forms. Lastly, you'd set up automated processes, like sending a restock request when inventory gets low. These processes are made using NocoBase's workflow feature, making sure business processes are automated and need less manual work.

#### **Strengths**

* **Data model driven**: Unlike many no-code products that create data structures directly in the user interface, NocoBase allows complex data structure design deep in the system backend, outside the UI. This increases the flexibility and scalability of applications. This approach is better for systems that need to handle complex business logic.
* **Plugin-based structure**: Uses a microkernel and plugin design. All features are provided through plugins, so users can customize and expand system functions as needed.
* **Workflow automation**: Has a built-in workflow control system. This achieves efficient business operations and management by automating data flows and business process organization.
* **Enterprise-level security**: Offers advanced user authentication and permission management features. This ensures data and application safety, suitable for business environments that need strict data protection.

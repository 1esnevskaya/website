In last month's article, we explored BPM and summarized the three key steps to building BPM applications.

[What is BPM and How to Build a BPM App?](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/business-process-management)

However, BPM faces unique challenges across various industries. In education, optimizing enrollment management processes and enhancing student satisfaction are crucial; the manufacturing sector deals with complex supply chains and production scheduling challenges; the financial services industry emphasizes the importance of real-time data updates and compliance monitoring; while retail focuses on inventory management and improving customer experience.

Therefore, we will delve into the pain points of BPM in these industries and recommend corresponding BPM solutions.

**Itâ€™s worth noting that the open-source tools recommended in this article are not specifically tailored to the listed industries. We aim to help readers understand and effectively utilize these tools by considering the unique needs of each sector.**

## 1.Education Sector

### **Typical Scenario**

At a prestigious university's admissions office, staff member Anna is overwhelmed. Her computer screen is cluttered with windows: video conferencing platforms, support request management systems, FAQs, and electronic folders for student applications. Constantly switching between these tools, Anna struggles to track every application while facing the challenge of information silos. Every new support request makes her sigh, as the lack of data synchronization hampers her ability to respond quickly. The university aims to provide better educational content through video conferencing, but the difficulty of integrating existing systems makes this goal seem out of reach. She wonders why there can't be a unified, efficient management system to simplify everything.

## 2.Manufacturing Sector

### **Typical Scenario**

In a large factory, machines roar on the production line as workers prepare for upcoming orders.

Without real-time data analysis tools, they struggle to evaluate alternative solutions, severely impacting production efficiency.

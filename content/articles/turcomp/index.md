## **About Turcomp**

On the west coast of Sabah, near the island of Borneo in East Malaysia, there is an island of only 92 square kilometers – Labuan. With a population of only 80,000, Labuan is an international offshore financial center and free trade zone.

The Labuan region is rich in oil and gas fields, which has led to the development of various oil and gas-related industries, including oil refining and natural gas liquefaction. [Turcomp Engineering Services Sdn Bhd](https://www.turcomp.com/), also known as Turcomp, was founded in Labuan in 1992. The name "Turcomp" is a combination of "Turbine" and "Compressor," reflecting the company's focus on turbocharger and compressor technologies.

After more than 30 years of development, Turcomp has become an integrated service and solutions provider for the oil & gas and energy industry with 15 offices in major cities in Malaysia.

## **A Journey Toward Efficiency and Autonomy**

Due to the oil industry's data-sensitive nature, Turcomp tended to develop in-house digital systems to achieve full control of the data and the system. Due to Turcomp's fast development, in-house development must be agile and efficient while ensuring strict data security.

As one of Turcomp's IT directors said, "While proficient in various programming languages and advanced frameworks such as Laravel and Django, we recognize the inherent complexities and time-consuming nature of traditional development processes."

Traditional development was complex and required highly skilled developers, and sometimes, it often meant relying heavily on external parties. As a result, Turcomp began investigating low-code and no-code platforms to introduce a development platform that would enable agile development while ensuring security.

## **Focusing on Speed and Safety**

Among the many options of no-code and low-code platforms, Turcomp found NocoBase.

Once the product concepts were validated, NocoBase became an essential development tool for Turcomp. It facilitated rapid development and ensured compliance with security protocols.

As the IT Development Team at Turcomp emphasized, NocoBase was the preferred choice for the following reasons:

* Straightforward and user-friendly interfaces for fast prototype design;
* Extendable plugins to tailor to precise requirements;
* Embedded high data security policy to prevent data breaches;
* Seamless data exchange among multiple systems;
* In-promise deployment to have full control of the system and data.

With a full suite of comprehensive features, NocoBase enables Turcomp to quickly design customized module systems to meet its specific needs and facilitate seamless data exchange among systems without compromising security protocols. Additionally, it allows the integration of existing systems into NocoBase for unified management, thereby improving operational efficiency.

**The Turcomp team can now utilize NocoBase to rapidly develop the internal management systems and deploy them securely without heavy dependence on external parties, significantly reducing development time.**

## **Leveraging NocoBase to drive Innovation and Progress**

Recently, Turcomp has developed multiple modules with NocoBase, including Timesheets and HR systems. The [LDAP authentication plugin](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/auth-ldap) seamlessly integrates Turcomp's existing user authentication system with NocoBase, allowing users to start using NocoBase without any obstacles.

It's important to note that NocoBase's extraordinary extension design allowed the development of **the LDAP authentication plugin was developed, documented, and tested in just two days**—a task that previously would have taken over a week.

As the IT team commended:

> "Nocobase's versatility has transcended our initial expectations, revolutionized our development workflows, and fostered a culture of innovation within our organization. Its comprehensive suite of features has endowed us with newfound flexibility and efficiency, enabling us to navigate complex challenges with unparalleled agility and efficacy."

Since NocoBase was introduced, Turcomp has improved in-house development's agility, efficiency, and security, strengthening its leading position in the industry. With NocoBase's ongoing growth and expansion, it will continue to support Turcomp's innovation and progress in the oil and gas sector.

> "In summary, Nocobase has emerged as the cornerstone of our no-code development endeavors, catalyzing tangible progress and reinforcing our commitment to excellence in the oil and gas sector. We commend its efficacy and commendability, acknowledging its instrumental role in our continued success and growth trajectory."

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a widely adopted access control model that maps **users â†’ roles â†’ permissions** in a structured and manageable way. Its simplicity, auditability, and flexibility across diverse business scenarios have made it a default choice for many enterprise-grade systems.

As companies grow and user roles become increasingly diverse, managing secure, fine-grained access control has become a significant challenge.

This explains why RBAC-related topics frequently surface in developer communities like Reddit.

One developer [shared on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1liinza/rbac_tools/) how difficult it was to manage OAuth login and assign user roles, and was looking for an **easy-to-setup and free RBAC tool** to streamline the workflow.

Another [Reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/sailpoint/comments/1iny3lt/curious_what_yall_do_for_rbac/) discussed their companyâ€™s struggle to transition from manual provisioning to a unified role-based access approachâ€”especially when **each role involves multiple approvers or teams**, making cross-departmental collaboration extremely complex.
